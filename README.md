Ensuring safety and quality of food whilst also meeting high consumer demand is a great challenge in the food industry. Maintaining standards requires food business operators to adhere to strict regulations and testing, though current testing methods are known to be inefficient, expensive and produce retrospective results. Furthermore, transparency and traceability of products is known to be a weak link within the food supply chain. As a result, digital technologies have now started gaining popularity in an effort to improve on these issues. The use of non-invasive analytical technologies in combination with machine learning has recently gained popularity as an efficient alternative for assessing the quality of foodstuffs. Analysis of analytical data is more complex, therefore the sorfML platform was originally developed as a user-friendly web application to determine the most suitable machine learning algorithms for predicting spoilage or authenticity using analytical data. This project has built on the sorfML functionalities with the addition of a new product tracking system to address the lack of traceability across the agri-food supply chain.
